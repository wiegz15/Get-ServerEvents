This is a WIP set of scripts that will create a GUI to run the Powershell Get-WinEvents command.

It will scan for servers running any Windows Server OS.  You select the dates you want to scan and the Event level you want to see. 

There will be a Export to CSV function or a grid view on the GUI to view and sort the data you grab.
